This is my first python project related to fantasy football and data analysis using the pandas library.
Lots of the code is getting familiar with basic data grabbing from .csv files, data manipulation in pandas, and data visualization in seaborn.
The data used in this program comes from fantasydatapros and is for the 2023-2024 season

The last section of the code is for a draft tool called "Value Over Replacement."
This tool builds off the methods demonstrated in the earlier sections of code.

This code is written in Google Colab and is most easily viewed in Google Colab.
Each code cell is meant to be run individually.
In order for programs to run properly click the "Runtime" tab and then "run all" to see the results of all the code cells.
