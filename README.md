This is my first python project related to fantasy football and data analysis using the pandas library.
Lots of the code is getting familiar with basic data manipulation adn visualization methods in pandas with the end goal of creating a draft tool based off "Value Over Replacement"
The data used in this program comes from fantasydatapros and is for the 2023-2024 season

This code is written in Google Colab so the entire program is made of small programs designed to be executed individually in code cells.
In order for programs to run properly click the "Runtime" tab and then "run all" to see the results of all the code cells.
